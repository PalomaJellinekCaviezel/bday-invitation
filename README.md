# Bday invitations creator
A web application that allows the administrator user to **create birthday invitations through a data entry form.** The event data is displayed on the **personalized invitation ready to share.**

## The challenge

Admin users can:

- Fill out a form to create a birthday invitation with details like guest of honor, date, location, and a personalized message.
- Generate a dynamic invitation template for sharing, with real-time data updates for customizations.

Users who receive the invitation link can:

- View the interactive invitation details, including event time, date, and location.
- Confirm their attendance through a direct RSVP button that opens WhatsApp for easy response.
- Access the exact event location with a button redirecting to Google Maps using the event’s URL, simplifying navigation.
